#### Smart Distribution Example

When sending 100 messages with 2 connected devices:
```
Device A: 50 messages (Round-robin distribution)
Device B: 50 messages (Round-robin distribution)
```
**Benefits**: Faster bulk sending & prevents carrier rate-limiting on single SIM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 20+ | JavaScript runtime |
| **pnpm** | Latest | Package manager |
| **Java** | 17+ | Android builds |
| **Rust** | Latest | Tauri desktop builds |

### Step 1: Android Gateway Setup

```bash
# Navigate to phone directory
cd phone

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run on Android Device (requires USB debugging enabled)
pnpm run dev:android
```

#### Configuration Steps

Once the app is running on your phone:

1. **Start Server**: Tap the "Start Server" button
2. **Note Connection Details**: Check the IP address and Port (default: `8080`)
3. **Configure SIM**: Set your default SIM in the "SIM Configuration" card
4. **Enable Background Running**: Use the "Power" and "Zap" icons to keep the app active

> **Tip**: Make sure your phone and computer are on the same network for local API access.

### Step 2: Desktop Dashboard Setup

```bash
# Navigate to desktop directory
cd desktop

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Option 1: Start Web Development Server
pnpm run dev

# Option 2: Start Tauri Development (native desktop app)
pnpm run tauri:dev

# Option 3: Build Tauri Desktop App for production
pnpm run tauri:build
```

## API Usage

The Gateway exposes a standardized JSON API for easy integration.

### Send SMS

**Endpoint**: `POST /sms`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "number": "01700000000",
  "message": "Hello from Pathway!"
}
```

**Example with cURL**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:8080/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "number": "01700000000",
    "message": "Hello from Pathway!"
  }'
```

### Run USSD

**Endpoint**: `POST /ussd`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "code": "*124#"
}
```

**Example with cURL**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:8080/ussd \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "*124#"
  }'
```

> **Note**: The API uses the app's globally configured "Preferred SIM" setting.

## Automated Builds (CI/CD)

GitHub Actions automatically build artifacts on push:

| Component | Trigger | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Android App** | Push to `/phone` | `app-debug.apk` (Debug APK via Capacitor) |
| **Desktop App** | Push to `/desktop` | Static site zip + Native executables (Windows, macOS, Linux) |

---

## Creating Releases

Releases are automatically created when you push a version tag.

### Quick Start

1. **Create a version tag** (following semantic versioning):
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Push the tag** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Automatic Build** - The release workflow will:
   - Build Android APK (`app-debug.apk`)
   - Build Desktop static site (`desktop-build.zip`)
   - Build native apps for Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Create GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
   - Attach all artifacts for download

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes the following downloadable files:

| Artifact | Platform | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `app-debug.apk` | Android | Gateway application (install directly) |
| `desktop-build.zip` | Web | Static site (extract and host) |
| `pathway-desktop_*.AppImage` | Linux | Portable executable (no installation) |
| `pathway-desktop_*.deb` | Linux | Debian package |
| `Pathway Desktop.exe` | Windows | Portable executable (no installation) |
| `Pathway Desktop_*-setup.exe` | Windows | NSIS installer |
| `Pathway Desktop_*.dmg` | macOS | Disk image |

### Quick Release Commands

```bash
# Create and push a new release
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0

# Create a pre-release version
git tag v1.0.0-beta.1 && git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1

# List all existing tags
git tag -l

# Delete a tag locally and remotely (if needed)
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```

## Limitations

### Android Gateway Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Workaround |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Battery & Power Management** | Android may kill the app in the background despite optimization settings | Keep device plugged in and disable battery optimization for the app |
| **Network Requirements** | Both phone and desktop must be on the same local network | Use VPN or port forwarding for remote access |
| **Phone Must Stay Powered** | The device needs to remain on and connected to power for 24/7 operation | Use a dedicated device or ensure continuous power supply |
| **Android Version** | Requires Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher | Use a supported device |
| **Permissions** | Requires SMS and Phone permissions at runtime | Grant all requested permissions during setup |

### Desktop Dashboard Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Workaround |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Local Network Only** | Default setup works only on local network | Configure network routing or VPN for remote access |
| **No SMS Reception** | Currently only supports sending SMS, not receiving | Future feature consideration |
| **Manual Device Management** | Devices must be manually added to the dashboard | Keep track of device IPs (consider static IP assignment) |
| **No Cloud Sync** | All data is stored locally on the desktop app | Backup desktop app data regularly |

### Technical Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Carrier Rate Limits** | Mobile carriers may throttle or block bulk SMS sending | Use multiple devices or spread sending over time |
| **SMS Character Limits** | Standard SMS: 160 characters (Unicode: 70 characters) | Long messages automatically split into multiple parts |
| **USSD Session Timeout** | USSD sessions may timeout based on carrier settings | Execute USSD codes promptly |
| **No End-to-End Encryption** | API communication is not encrypted by default | Use on trusted networks or implement HTTPS |
| **No Built-in Analytics** | Limited analytics and reporting features | Export logs for external analysis |

### Known Issues

- **Android 12+**: Some aggressive battery optimization requires manual intervention in device settings
- **Dual SIM**: SIM switching may have a slight delay depending on the device
- **Background Restrictions**: Some Android manufacturers (Xiaomi, Huawei, etc.) have additional restrictions that need to be disabled manually

> **Tip**: For production use, we recommend using a dedicated Android device that stays powered and connected to ensure maximum reliability.

## Generative AI

This project utilizes code created by the following models: Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro Preview, Claude 4.5 Opus.
All code generated by them have been throughly inspected however problems may arise.
No "vibe coding" was done. A human wrote majority of the code. AI was utilized to speedup development of simple features.
